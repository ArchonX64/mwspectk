=======================================

A Python program/library that provides functions for analyzing and simplifying Fourier-transform microwave spectra.

mwspectk.py is a Python file that can be dropped anywhere and used to provide functions and classes

CDP_Finder.cpp is an experimental feature. You'll need to compile it and put it in the correct directory for now, but I'll simplify it in the future.

Required Python Dependencies:

* NumPy
* SciPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Tkinter or PySide6 (for matplotlib backend, can be configured in mwspectk file)
